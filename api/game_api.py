"""This module provides access to API routes/views to requesting clients for Bad Banana game.

While modules from the badbanana package are used to generate questions and 
calculate/verify answers, the game_api module helps by doing the 'admin' work that
makes playing the game possible, such as keeping score and determining when users
have lost.

Client-side session cookies are used to maintain state. The downside of this is 
that it is possible to 'cheat' by inspecting a cookie for an answer. While storing 
data server-side would've been more secure, I could not get it to work properly 
(something to do with the proxy setup of this project...). Client-side
session cookies are not an ideal solution, but they are a reasonable one for this gameâ€”I 
would hope programmers have better uses of their time than hacking to find the answer for 
7 x 6.
